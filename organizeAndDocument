I’d like help organizing and documenting the project in my current working directory. 

Please: 

- Analyze the repository structure and summarize the purpose of each major folder, project or module. 

- Identify logical groupings based on functionality, technology or use case. 

- Propose a clearer folder and navigation structure to improve discoverability. 

- Create or expand documentation, including: 

  - A main README.md outline that explains the purpose of the repository and how to navigate its contents. 

  - Suggestions for onboarding and getting started documentation for new contributors or users. 

- Recommend improvements to the repository’s information architecture and any existing documentation site (if applicable).
